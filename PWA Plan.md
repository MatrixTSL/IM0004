Plan: Converting Your Electron App to a PWA
1. Analyse Electron-Specific Features
Main Process / Node.js APIs:
Tasks such as window management, file access, opening PDFs, or reading/writing files with fs—these are not supported in browsers and need alternatives.

Preload Script / ContextBridge:
Used to safely expose APIs from the main process to the renderer. Not needed in a web app.

IPC (Inter-Process Communication):
Electron uses ipcMain and ipcRenderer for secure comms between processes. Not needed for PWAs.

File System Access:
Electron allows full file system access. In a PWA, you must use browser APIs such as the File System Access API, downloads, or uploads.

PDF Handling:
Opening files in external apps isn’t possible in the browser; you must use in-browser viewers or prompt for download.

Settings Storage:
Electron apps may store settings in a file. PWAs should use localStorage, sessionStorage, or IndexedDB.

2. Create a Feature Mapping Table
Feature	Electron Method	PWA Alternative
Window Management	BrowserWindow	Not needed
IPC	ipcMain/ipcRenderer	Direct function calls
File Access	fs	Browser File APIs
Settings	settings.json	localStorage/IndexedDB
PDF Handling	Shell.openPath	PDF.js/in-browser viewer
Theme/Branding	CSS/config	CSS variables, localStorage

3. High-Level Steps
A. Refactor Codebase

Remove all Electron and Node.js API usage from the renderer/UI code.

Decouple any features relying on IPC, Node, or the main process.

B. Replace Node/Electron Features

Switch from settings.json to browser storage (localStorage or IndexedDB).

Use browser-based file handling (<input type="file">, <a download>, File System Access API) as needed.

Use PDF.js or a browser-friendly solution for PDF viewing.

C. Implement PWA Fundamentals

Add a manifest.json for app metadata, icons, and theme colour.

Add a Service Worker for offline support and caching.

Serve everything over HTTPS.

Test responsiveness across all screen sizes.

D. UI Adaptation

Remove or adapt any desktop-only UI elements.

Optimise for touch and smaller screens.

E. Build and Deploy

Use your frontend build tool to bundle your app (Webpack, Vite, etc.).

Deploy to a web server or a platform like Netlify or Vercel.

4. Example Checklist
Area	Action
Code	Remove Node/Electron imports
Delete main process, preload, IPC code
Update file and settings storage logic
UI	Remove window controls if present
Docs	Update README, focus on web features
Settings	Move to browser storage

5. PWA Requirements
Manifest: /manifest.json with app info and icons.

Service Worker: For offline and installability.

HTTPS: Required for service worker and PWA features.

Responsive Design: Ensure UI works on all devices.
